### Multi-phase or multi-PR plan

**You own the plan, not the code. The plan is a checklist an owner runs box by box and the user audits from the evidence.** For work that spans phases or stacked PRs. The plan is the deliverable. Do not implement.

1. When the change is one or two files with an obvious approach, skip the plan. Say so and stop.
2. Settle open questions by prototype before you write. For a question about layout, timing, behavior, or whether an API works, run `playbooks/prototype.md`. Keep the branch, the SHA, and the screenshots for Appendix A. Ask the user only about a product or preference call that no run can settle. Give options (the **never-block-on-the-human** principle skill).
3. Explore in subagents with `subagent_type: "pstack:poteto-agent"` and an explicit model per the Subagents section (the **guard-the-context-window** principle skill). Each returns file pointers, conventions, test commands, and entry points. No inlined dumps.
4. Copy the skeleton below into the plan file and fill every placeholder. Unless the user names a path, write the file under `docs/`. Keep every heading and every sub-block in the order shown. One section per PR. One PR is one change with its own evidence (the **sequence-verifiable-units** principle skill). Name the execution playbook in **How to read this**. `playbooks/autopilot-full.md`, `playbooks/autopilot-stack.md`, and `playbooks/orchestrate.md` are the execution playbooks this skeleton assumes, and `playbooks/shipping.md` is where a stack lands. All four are currently deferred (see `TODO.md`); until one is ported, name the manually-driven equivalent instead — the user runs the checklist themselves, one PR at a time, per `playbooks/babysit.md`'s pattern.
5. Write under the **technical-writing** skill in full, then the **unslop** skill. The body is one Diátaxis mode, how-to. Appendices hold explanation and reference. Two rules apply verbatim: "i dont want any abstract metaphors" and "write like hemingway". Each heading states the task or the finding. No long dashes. No mid-sentence colons.
6. Run `node scripts/check-plan.mjs <plan.md>` and fix every line it prints (the **encode-lessons-in-structure** principle skill). It enforces the skeleton's shape, the verification rule in every verification block, and the punctuation rules.
7. Hand back. Post the plan path and the script's output, then stop. Execution starts on the user's explicit go, under the execution playbook the plan names.

**Verification.** Tests alone are not sufficient verification. A PR is verified only when its unit, live, and perf boxes are all checked (the **prove-it-works** principle skill). That sentence is the verification rule. Every verification block opens with it. The live block is mandatory. Ten lanes at the PR head, on the **swarm** skill's worker model, drive the real surface through its control skill. Each lane is one box with a concrete scenario, the screenshot it saves, and its pass predicate. The perf block names the metric, the probe, the trunk baseline measured first, and the rule with the number that fails. A PR that changes an interaction is review-gated. The user reviews it in chat with screenshots and a video before merge. A PR that changes no interaction writes `**Review gate.** None. <PR id> is not review-gated.` and no boxes under it.

**Control skill.** Pick it by surface. Browser, Electron, and web UIs use `control-ui` from `cursor-team-kit`. CLIs and TUIs use `control-cli` from `cursor-team-kit`. Native mobile uses whatever simulator-driving skill the repo has. A PR that touches two surfaces gets lanes on both. A surface with no control skill is a risk in Appendix C, and its live block still names how each lane drives it.

**Execution-playbook dependency.** The Program checklist below (Arm the program, Boot recipe) describes the standing-coordinator model that `playbooks/orchestrate.md`, `playbooks/autopilot-full.md`, and `playbooks/autopilot-stack.md` implement, and that `playbooks/shipping.md` lands from. All four are deferred pending a Graphite/RemoteTrigger redesign (see `TODO.md`) — Claude Code has no standing-directive primitive today, and a per-lane cloud VM is not yet a real target either. Until that work lands, run this checklist under a manually-driven session instead. The user holds the plan and drives the audit tick themselves, in a real terminal `/loop` per `playbooks/babysit.md`'s pattern, and each lane runs in an isolated worktree rather than on a cloud VM.

# <Program> plan

<Under ten lines. What changes, for whom, the rule the program enforces, and the PR ids in order.>

## How to read this

One box is one unit of work. Every box names the evidence that checks it. A nested box is a sub-step of the box above it. Check a box only when its evidence exists, a file, a log line, a screenshot, a test run, or a SHA. The body is a how-to. The appendices explain and record.

The program runs `playbooks/<execution playbook>.md`. <Who merges, and which PR ids are the user's items that stop at merge-ready.>

Tests alone are not sufficient verification. A PR is verified only when its unit, live, and perf boxes are all checked.

## Program checklist

### Arm the program

- [ ] State the protocol and this plan to the user, then stop. Start execution only on their explicit go.
- [ ] Claude Code has no standing-directive primitive today (see `TODO.md`). Until the execution-playbook redesign lands, run this checklist as a manually-driven session. The user holds the plan and this checklist open for the whole run instead of delegating to a standing coordinator.
- [ ] Re-read these fresh at program start, and again at every tick. Don't rely on memory of an earlier read.
  - [ ] The execution playbook the plan names, or its manually-driven equivalent above.
  - [ ] The **swarm** skill.
  - [ ] The chosen control skill (`control-ui` or `control-cli` from `cursor-team-kit`).
  - [ ] `playbooks/opening-a-pr.md`.
  - [ ] Each other leaf skill the program uses.
- [ ] Arm the 30-minute audit tick with a real terminal `/loop` in dynamic mode. Never leave the cadence to memory.
- [ ] Use this tick prompt, verbatim. "Re-read the execution playbook and this plan. Audit the operation against both and fix drift in this tick. Probe every active lane and judge progress by side effects only. Stand down a stuck lane and dispatch its replacement now. Then send the user a status message, whether or not anything changed, with the queue table of PR, owner, state, and head SHA, the verdicts since the last tick, what merged, open user gates, and blockers."
- [ ] On the user's hold or stand-down, send every owner a zero-writes order at once.

### Spawn owners

- [ ] Spawn one owner per PR with the full lifecycle the execution playbook names.
- [ ] Follow this dependency graph. Start dependent work only after its parent merges, or base it on the parent branch when the execution playbook stacks.
  - [ ] <PR id> and <PR id> are independent and first. Both branch from `main`.
  - [ ] <PR id> after <PR id>.
- [ ] Hold the file boundaries. <PR id or class> touches only `<glob>`.
- [ ] Hold the review gate. <PR ids> change an interaction. They wait for the user's review in chat with screenshots and a video before merge.

### PR mechanics, for every PR

- [ ] Open the PR/MR per `playbooks/opening-a-pr.md`, ready and never draft, or with Graphite `gt` for a stack.
- [ ] Run the repo's lint and typecheck once before the PR-facing push. Push with hooks on.
- [ ] Run the **deslop** skill before each commit and the **no-comments** skill before review.
- [ ] Triage every automated review bot and security-reviewer comment per `../references/bugbot-triage.md`.
- [ ] Rebase onto current trunk before babysit and again before the merge-ready report.

### Verdict and merge, for every PR

- [ ] At the merge-ready head SHA, run the **swarm** skill. One gates lane. The ten live lanes from the PR's **Verify, live** block. The perf lane from its **Verify, perf** block. One audit lane that reads the diff and the receipts and distrusts the PR body.
- [ ] Clean only when every lane is `PASS`. Findings go back to the owner. A new head gets a fresh swarm and a fresh verdict.
- [ ] <The merge or append rule from the execution playbook, with the patch-id rule from `playbooks/shipping.md`.>

### Boot recipe, for every live lane

Each live lane runs against its own isolated checkout, a worktree, or an `Agent` call with `isolation: "remote"` when a lane doesn't need this machine's local state, at the PR head. Drive through `control-ui` or `control-cli` from `cursor-team-kit`.

- [ ] `git fetch origin <head-branch> && git checkout <head SHA>`.
- [ ] <Start the backend and the surface. Wait for ready.>
- [ ] <Deliver input only through the control skill's commands. Name the read-only diagnostics.>
- [ ] Save every screenshot to `/tmp/swarm-<pr-id>/worker-<n>/<slug>.png` and return the paths with the report.

## <Task as a verb phrase> (<PR id>)

**Depends on.** <PR id, or None.>

**Files.**

- [ ] Edit `<path>`.
- [ ] Create `<path>`.
- [ ] Delete `<path>`.

**Build.**

- [ ] <One change. Name the symbol and the file.>

**You see.**

- [ ] <One observable result, with the exact log line or screen state.>

**Verify, unit.** Tests alone are not sufficient verification. A PR is verified only when its unit, live, and perf boxes are all checked.

- [ ] <Test file and the case it gains.> Run `<command>`.

**Verify, live.** Tests alone are not sufficient verification. A PR is verified only when its unit, live, and perf boxes are all checked. Ten lanes at the PR head, on the swarm skill's worker model, per the boot recipe.

- [ ] Lane 1. <Scenario.> Save `<slug>.png`. Pass when <predicate>.
- [ ] Lane 2. <Scenario.> Save `<slug>.png`. Pass when <predicate>.
- [ ] Lane 3. <Scenario.> Save `<slug>.png`. Pass when <predicate>.
- [ ] Lane 4. <Scenario.> Save `<slug>.png`. Pass when <predicate>.
- [ ] Lane 5. <Scenario.> Save `<slug>.png`. Pass when <predicate>.
- [ ] Lane 6. <Scenario.> Save `<slug>.png`. Pass when <predicate>.
- [ ] Lane 7. <Scenario.> Save `<slug>.png`. Pass when <predicate>.
- [ ] Lane 8. <Scenario.> Save `<slug>.png`. Pass when <predicate>.
- [ ] Lane 9. <Scenario.> Save `<slug>.png`. Pass when <predicate>.
- [ ] Lane 10. <Scenario.> Save `<slug>.png`. Pass when <predicate>.

**Verify, perf.** Tests alone are not sufficient verification. A PR is verified only when its unit, live, and perf boxes are all checked.

- [ ] Metric. <What is measured.>
- [ ] Probe. <The command or procedure, run at trunk and at the head, interleaved.>
- [ ] Baseline. Record the trunk <value> first.
- [ ] Rule. <Head against trunk, with the number that fails.>

**Review gate.** The user reviews before merge.

- [ ] Copy lane <n> screenshots into `<media path>/<pr-id>-review-<slug>.png`.
- [ ] Record a 30 to 60 second video of the change on the lane's checkout. Save it as `<media path>/<pr-id>-review.mp4`.
- [ ] Post the screenshots and the video in chat. Stop at merge-ready. Wait for the user's click.

**Merge.**

- [ ] The swarm's clean verdict at the exact head SHA.
- [ ] Automated review bot triage done.
- [ ] Rebased onto current trunk after the verdict, patch-id unchanged.
- [ ] <The owner squash-merges its own PR, or the coordinator appends the PR to the Graphite stack and the user lands it.>

## Close the program

- [ ] Every box above is checked with its evidence.
